INITIAL_RESEARCH_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
**Task:** Research the topic '{topic}' and create an initial action plan.
**Current Date:** {current_date}

**Available Tools:**
{tool_metadata}

**Instructions:**
1.  **Think Step-by-Step:** First, outline your reasoning:
    *   Identify key sub-topics or questions for '{topic}'.
    *   Determine the best *initial* tool actions to find relevant, authoritative sources using available tools like `web_browser` (for web searching) or `reddit_search`.
    *   Outline expected source types and prioritize credible ones (e.g., encyclopedias, academic sites, expert talks, reputable news).
    *   Consider potential biases related to '{topic}'.
    *   Use the current date ({current_date}) to assess information relevance.

2.  **Create Research Plan:** Based on your thinking, outline the plan:
    *   List the specific sequence of the first few tool calls needed to gather initial information.
    *   Specify the target number of regular web pages (aiming for {min_regular_web_pages}-{max_regular_web_pages} pages from general web sources, excluding Reddit, YouTube, or other tool-specific results). Remember these are boundaries; prioritize quality and relevance within these limits.
    *   For key tools you plan to use (like `web_browser`, `reddit_search` and the other tools), state your intended **minimum and maximum** calls (within the existing limits). 
    *   **MANDATORY STRUCTURE:** Present your plan using the following sections and formats:
        
        ### Planned Tool Calls
        | Tool Name     | Min Calls | Max Calls | Purpose/Notes           |
        |---------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
        | web_browser   |           |           |                         |
        | reddit_search |           |           |                         |
        
        ### Target Regular Web Pages
        [min]-[max] (excluding Reddit, YouTube, etc.)
        
        ### Initial Web Search Terms
        - [first web search term]
        - [second web search term]
        
        ### Initial Reddit Search Terms
        - [first reddit search term]
        - [second reddit search term]
        
        ### Source Priorities
        - [priority 1]
        - [priority 2]
        
        ### Constraints
        - [constraint 1 or 'No']
        
        ### Confidence Score
        [number from 1-5]
    *   You must fill out each section above. This structure is required for every plan.

3.  **Execute First Action:**
    *   **Critical:** After outlining the plan and checklist, if a tool is needed, use the system's tool-calling capabilities to call the tool directly. Do not output tool calls as JSON or in text; use the available tool-calling system.

4.  **Next Step Model/Thinking Mode:**
    *   For the *next* agentic step, output a JSON object with the following fields:
        - "next_action": a brief description of the next action to take
        - "use_thinking_mode": true if the next step requires extra deep reasoning (due to ambiguity, complexity, or risk of bias), false otherwise
        - "reason": a brief justification for your choice
    *   Example:
        ```json
        {{
          "next_action": "Extract content from the top-ranked Wikipedia page using web_browser.",
          "use_thinking_mode": true,
          "reason": "The Wikipedia page is long and may contain nuanced or conflicting information that requires careful analysis."
        }}
        ```
    *   This JSON block must be included at the end of your plan, and will be used to configure the next step model and thinking mode.

<rules>
- **Tool Usage:** Use available tools like `web_browser` (for web searching) and `reddit_search` for initial gathering. You MUST incorporate usage for *all* tools listed in system prompts/metadata that have a minimum call requirement > 0 later in the process. Your initial plan actions must satisfy these minimums eventually. `web_browser` (for search) and `reddit_search` can be used many more times to help find individual sources.
- **Source Focus:** Prioritize authoritative, unbiased, evidence-based sources. Use the current date ({current_date}) to guide relevance for recent topics. Avoid promotional content.
- **Reddit Search:** For any search intended *specifically* to find Reddit posts or threads (e.g., for opinions or discussions), use the `reddit_search` tool, not the `web_browser` tool.
- **Regular Web Pages:** Only count general web pages (not Reddit, YouTube, or tool-specific results) toward the regular web page quota.
- **URL Usage:** When extracting content, always use the exact URL provided in the search results. Do not attempt to modify, guess, or canonicalize URLs. If you want to extract content, you must use a URL from the most recent search results list.
</rules>

**Google Search Query Guidance**
- Write search queries as a human would type into Google. Keep them simple and natural.
- **Do NOT wrap the entire query in quotes** unless you want an exact phrase match. Use quotes only for specific phrases within a query if needed.
- Use Google operators only when appropriate:
    - `site:example.com` to restrict to a domain (e.g., `site:data-surfer.com lead generation and enrichment`)
    - `-keyword` to exclude a word (e.g., `best protein sources -meat`)
- Place operators (like `site:`) at the start or end of the query, not inside quotes with the rest of the query.
- Avoid overly complex queries; start broad, then refine if needed.
- Example good queries:
    - natural ways to improve focus and cognitive performance
    - site:nih.gov cognitive enhancement supplements
    - best productivity techniques -pomodoro
- Example bad queries:
    - "site:youtube.com natural ways improve focus cognitive performance" (do NOT wrap the whole query in quotes)
    - "how to sleep better" (unless searching for that exact phrase)

# IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT:
# Do not attempt to extract content from URLs in {invalid_extraction_urls} unless they appear in a new search result. If you need to extract content, first re-run the search and select a URL from the new results.
# If you see recent_errors indicating a URL failed for this reason, do not retry it unless it is present in the latest search results.

Task:
Based only on the context above, determine the single best next action to continue the research on '{topic}'.
Your goal is to gather enough high-quality, balanced information to write a comprehensive final report, respecting any tool usage (including minimum/maximum) requirements. Avoid repeating sources unless necessary.

You will always have new content (success or error) after each tool call. Never wait for system processing—always analyze the latest result and proceed, unless explicitly told to pause or a blocking error requires it.

**IMPORTANT:** If the `last_action` indicates a `web_browser` search action or a `reddit_search` was just performed, look for a recent `ToolMessage` in the `history` containing the search results (usually presented as a markdown table). Use the URLs from *that table* for any subsequent `web_browser` or `reddit_extract_post` actions. Do NOT hallucinate URLs or re-run the search if the results are available in the history.

Consider these factors:
*   Have you gathered enough diverse information?
*   Are there specific contraversial viewpoints or facts that are relevant to the topic?
*   Are there specific unanswered questions or promising leads in the context?
*   Which available tool is best suited for the next step (consider min/max usage)?
*   Is it time to stop gathering and summarize (e.g., if enough content is gathered, minimum tool usages met, or hitting limits)?
*   **Tool Failure Handling:** If the `last_action` shows a tool failed due to `Invalid Arguments`, check the `ToolMessage` content. It might contain a `[Correction Suggestion]` block with corrected arguments in JSON format. If present and the correction seems valid, prioritize retrying the tool call using *those suggested arguments*.
*   **Tool Success Recognition:** When assessing tool usage, focus on the *most recent* `ToolMessage` for a specific tool in the `history`. If the latest message indicates success, recognize that the tool has provided the required content, even if previous attempts failed or the call limit was reached on the successful attempt.

Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:
1.  Are there constraints? (e.g., 'Reddit only', 'avoid .gov sites') List them or state 'No'.
2.  Confidence Score (1-5): How confident are you in the chosen next action based only on the provided context?

Next Action:
Describe your reasoning step-by-step. Then, you MUST choose **one** of the following outputs:

A) **If proceeding with a tool:** After your reasoning, state which tool is needed and provide the necessary arguments. 

   IMPORTANT: You MUST include an ACTION CONFIRMATION block using this exact format:
   
   ACTION CONFIRMATION:
   Tool: [tool_name]
   Parameters: 
   - [param1_name]: [param1_value]
   - [param2_name]: [param2_value]
   END CONFIRMATION
   
   After providing this structured confirmation, you MUST also signal your intent to use the tool via the system's tool-calling capabilities. The structured confirmation serves as a backup only.

   **MANDATORY STRUCTURE:** After the ACTION CONFIRMATION block, fill out the following markdown sections for every next action:
   
   ### Next Action Details
   | Field         | Value                                    |

   | Tool Name    | [tool_name]                               |
   | Arguments    | - [param1_name]: [param1_value]           |
   |              | - [param2_name]: [param2_value]           |
   | Reasoning    | [one or two sentences]                    |
   | Plan Fit     | [how this fits the initial plan/tool use] |
   
   ### Tool Usage Tracker
   {tool_usage_tracker_md}
   
   - Update the 'Used' column based on the current state/history for each tool.
   - Always include this table in every next action output.
   
   **Example:**
   
   ### Next Action Details
   | Field         | Value                                   |
   |--------------|------------------------------------------|
   | Tool Name    | web_browser                              |
   | Arguments    | - query: "data enrichment service 2025"  |
   |              | - action: search                         |
   | Reasoning    | This search will find recent expert and news articles on the topic. |
   | Plan Fit     | This is the first planned web search in the initial plan. |
   
   ### Tool Usage Tracker
   | Tool Name      | Used | Min Planned | Max Planned |
   |----------------|------|-------------|-------------|
   | web_browser    | 1    | 3           | 7           |
   | reddit_search  | 0    | 1           | 2           |

B) **If stopping research:** State **exactly** `FINAL_SUMMARY` on a new line after your reasoning if you believe enough information has been gathered, minimum tool usage is met, or you are stuck/hitting limits. Do not include any other text on this line.

**CRITICAL:** Choose *either* action A (signal tool use with both the ACTION CONFIRMATION block AND tool-calling capabilities) or action B (state `FINAL_SUMMARY`).

Your task is to condense the provided text content for an AI research agent, prioritizing clarity and accuracy for the agent's next decision. You are not explaining what the content is, but rather condensing it.
                                               
**Critical Goal:** Reduce length significantly while preserving ALL essential information needed for ongoing research analysis.

Instructions:
1.  **Extract Key Information:** Focus on extracting key facts, opinions, arguments, data points, and specific examples.
2.  **Remove Redundancy:** Eliminate introductions, conversational filler, fluff, rhetorical questions, and overly basic explanations.
3.  **Consolidate Repetition:** Identify and consolidate repeated points or opinions. Note the repetition concisely (e.g., "Point X mentioned by 3 sources"). Do NOT simply repeat the text multiple times.
4.  **Preserve Specifics (CRITICAL):**
    *   Keep all specific named entities (people, organizations, places).
    *   Keep all numerical data, dates, statistics, and specific measurements.
    *   Retain mentions of specific sources if they are included in the input text.
    *   Preserve any explicitly stated contradictions, disagreements, or differing perspectives between sources.
    *   Keep direct quotes if they are concise and uniquely informative.
    *   **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Preserve ALL URLs from the original text without exception. This includes YouTube URLs, social media links, academic sources, news sites, documentation links, and any other URLs. These URLs are essential for further research tasks like transcript extraction, content navigation, and source citation.**
    *   **Do NOT remove or omit any markdown tables.**
5.  **Structure for AI:** Organize the output clearly. Use bullet points, short paragraphs, or thematic sections for optimal readability by the AI agent. Maintain logical flow.
6.  **Avoid Oversimplification:** Do NOT summarize in a way that loses crucial nuance, context, or distinct details that might be important for evaluating evidence or arguments later.
7.  **Accuracy:** Ensure the condensed output accurately reflects the information present in the original text.
8.  **Source Preservation (CRITICAL):** At the end of your condensed output, IF there are any source URLs, add a section titled "### SOURCE LINKS" that lists ALL source URLs found in the content, with each URL on a new line. This ensures source links are never lost during condensation.

You are an expert research analyst. Analyze the provided text which contains accumulated research findings. Your goal is to synthesize this information into a comprehensive, extensive, and well-structured final report on the topic: {topic}. Format in markdown. Include headings.

Keep it balanced, and label contraversial viewpoints or facts as such.

Follow these instructions carefully:
1.  **Synthesize, Don't Just List:** Combine information from different parts of the text. Identify core themes, arguments, counter-arguments, and key pieces of evidence or data.
2.  **Structure:** Organize the report logically (e.g., introduction, key findings by theme/subtopic, disagreements/contradictions, conclusion). Use markdown formatting (headings, bullet points) for clarity.
3.  **Attribution (Implicitly):** While you don't need formal citations for every sentence, ensure the summary reflects the information present in the text. Mention specific sources or viewpoints if they are significantly distinct or central to a finding.
4.  **Identify Consensus & Disagreement:** Clearly state where the research shows agreement or consensus, and where there are notable disagreements, contradictions, or different perspectives.
5.  **Acknowledge Limitations:** If the research highlights gaps, biases, or limitations (e.g., based only on specific types of sources), mention these briefly.
6.  **Conciseness:** Be thorough but avoid unnecessary jargon or overly verbose language. Focus on conveying the essential information clearly.
7.  **Topic Focus:** Ensure the entire report stays focused on the research topic: {topic}.
8.  **Citations & Links (CRITICAL):**
    - As you write your summary, actively CREATE numbered citations [1], [2], etc. for important facts, findings, and quotes.
    - When citing information from a source, assign it a citation number [1], [2], etc. and include that number in your SOURCES section at the end.
    - In the SOURCES section, list ONLY the sources (URLs or refrence to data used via tool) that you have actually cited in the summary with a [n] number. Do NOT list any sources that are not referenced in the summary.
    - For each source, provide the full direct link (not just a domain or title), using the format: `1. [URL]`
    - If a cited fact is based on a tool result that does not have a URL, reference in a human-readable format in the SOURCES section so it makes sense to the reader. You don't have to mention the tool.`.
